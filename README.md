- Description of current target for the game:
This will be a space-themed game. The game mechanics will revolve around ball play, similar to Rocket League — except the players will control spacecrafts that is fully traversable in a 3D plane.
There are 2 teams of 3 players and there are 2 goalposts at the opposite end of the map. To spice things up, objects such as asteroid fields or shipwrecks can be added in the middle of the map, which makes getting the ball from one side to another more difficult. If a player crashes into an asteroid, they will be spawned back at the starting position, potentially losing control of the ball to the other team.

An interesting concept for the game is the ability for the player to change their weapon loadout before entering the battle. In the current implementation, the player can choose from the followings: 
* Grappling hook: the player have to aim and shoot the hook at the ball. If hit, it will grab and pull the ball toward the player.
* EMP missile: aim and shoot at the enemy player. If hit, immobilized the player for a short amount of time.
* Smoke launcher: create a large area of smoke that completely obstructs the player’s vision inside. Perfect to use in the asteroid field to blind and cause the enemy player to crash.
Your choice of weapon will determine your role in the match.

Additionally, Space Soccer will feature a unique card system. When a team scores a goal, both teams return to their starting positions. The winning team will receive 1 point to their score counter. The losing team will be able to choose a card to improve their stats. The cards can be one of the followings:
* Increase acceleration & deceleration
* Increase maneuverability
* Increase firing rate of weapons
* Grant a shield in front of goalpost that will stop and deflect ball once.
